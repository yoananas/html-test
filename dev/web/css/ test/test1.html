          <p>
            The wall on which the prophets wrote
            Is cracking at the seams.
            Upon the instruments if death
            The sunlight brightly gleams.
            When every man is torn apart
            With nightmares and with dreams,
            Will no one lay the laurel wreath
            As silence drowns the screams.

              The choir softly sing; Three lullabies in an ancient tongue, For the court
              of the crimson king.

                The keeper of the city keys Puts shutters on the dreams. I wait outside
                the pilgrim's door With insufficient schemes. The black queen chants the
                funeral march, The cracked brass bells will ring; To summon back the fire
                witch To the court of the crimson king.

                The gardener plants an evergreen Whilst trampling on a flower. I chase the
                wind of a prism ship To taste the sweet and sour. The pattern juggler

                There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
                And she's buying a stairway to heaven
                When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
                With a word she can get what she came for
                Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven
